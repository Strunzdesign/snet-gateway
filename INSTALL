===

Initial download and setup on GNU/Linux:
---
Preparations:
- Install the "GCC toolchain"
- Install the "Boost Libraries"
- Install the "CMake" build system

To compile and install the s-net(r) gateway, just follow these steps:
1.) git clone --recursive https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-gateway.git
2.) cd snet-gateway
3.) mkdir build
4.) cd build
5.) cmake ..
6.) make
7.) make install (as root)

The binary will be installed to "/usr/local/bin/".



Initial download and setup on Microsoft Windows 7:
---
Preparations:
- Download the latest "nuwen MinGW" distribution from https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
- Assure that you pick a MinGW distribution that already includes "Git" and the "Boost Libraries"
- Follow the installation guide, e.g., unpack MinGW to C:\MinGW
- Add MinGW to the path according to the installation guide
- Download and install "CMake" from https://cmake.org/download

To compile and install the s-net(r) gateway, just follow these steps:
1.) Go to your projects' folder and open a shell there
2.) git clone --recursive https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-gateway.git
3.) cd snet-gateway
4.) mkdir build
5.) cd build
6.) Pick yourself a directory to install the compiled files, e.g., consider C:\snet-gateway
7.) cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/c/snet-gateway ..
8.) If you get an error message on step 10, repeat step 10 once
9.) make
10.) make install

The snet-gateway binary will be installed to "C:\snet-gateway\bin\" if not specified differently.



Update and recompile your local repository (same for all OS):
---
1.) cd snet-gateway
2.) git pull
3.) git submodule update
4.) cd build
5.) make
6.) make install

Have fun :-)
